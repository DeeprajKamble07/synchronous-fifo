# synchronous-fifo

This project implements a parameterized synchronous FIFO (First-In-First-Out) buffer in Verilog, along with a complete testbench to verify correct read/write and boundary behavior. The FIFO supports configurable data width and depth, and generates full and empty status flags based on pointer comparison.
